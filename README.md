## How to run

Get the code:

```
    git clone https://github.com/Simik31/AOC-2021.git
```

### C++

Open [`cpp/cpp.sln`](cpp/cpp.sln) in [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/ "Get Visual Studio") to build and run the project.

### C#

Open [`cs/cs.sln`](cs/cs.sln) in [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/ "Get Visual Studio") to build and run the project.

> Run for platform `x64` (and ideally in `Release` mode)!
>
> Data paths are hardcoded to `x64` path (`x64` has to go 5x `../` while `Any CPU` has to go `../` only 4x).

### Go

```console
    cd ./go
    go run .
```

### Java

Open [`java/AOC-2021.iml`](java/AOC-2021.iml) in [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/ "Get IntelliJ IDEA") to run the project.

> Run the project by clicking on the green arrow next to the [`public class Main {`](java/src/cz/simik31/aoc2021/Main.java#L3) in [`Main.java`](java/src/cz/simik31/aoc2021/Main.java).

### Node.js

```console
    cd ./nodejs
    node .
```

### PHP

❗PHP solution of Day 7 Part 2 is for whatever reason extremely slow. Please be patient.

- Run local server.
- In browser:

  - Access [`/index.php`](php/index.php) for all solutions
  - Access `/Day#.php` where # stands for day number

    Example: [`/Day5.php`](php/Day5.php) will get you solution of day 5.

### Python

```console
    cd ./python
    python main.py
```

Or you can run each solution separate:
